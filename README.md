## 📖 About the Project

**NEXT.JS-CRUDES** is my **first Next.js application**, built to understand the basics of:
- File-based routing  
- API routes  
- Server and client components  
- State management  
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  

This project helped me dive deep into the **Next.js ecosystem** while exploring TailwindCSS for UI styling.
